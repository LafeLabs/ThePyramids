# The Pyramids

## A Geometron/Trash Robot Thing

The Pyramids are a set of technological artifacts.  Each Pyramid is made from the same basic pattern, but they do different things and have different things added to them. 

All Trash Robot is made from upcycled components, rainbow duct tape, and googley eyes.  Geometron gives us a way to describe the geometry of the objects made from trash so that they can be replicated.  We make [Geometron Shapes](http://trashrobot.org/user.php?scroll=scrolls/shapes) from laser cut 1/8 inch neon green acrylic.  Or just construct them from paper with any geometry tools.  We make the ArtBox

The "brains" of The Pyramids are based on the Arduino UNO with a standard shield board which can be used for various applications.
